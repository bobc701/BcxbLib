I added SerializeResults to CGame, for idea of accessing in JavaScript.

11/22-16
I have gone through and implimented CTeam throughout and got clean compile,
It has now been (minimally) tested in iOS and CSApp -- it runs!


11/17-16:
I made a new branch (b1) and impliemnted CTeam.

#1605.02:
Added new class, CTEam, and instantiated a 2-elt array in CGame.
But have not fully integrated it into game logic.

#1605.01: 
I consolidated logic to combine batter & pitcher parameters into new method,
CombineParamsets. It is in CHittingParamset as a static. It is called from InitBatter,
peplacing logic that was there previously.


#1604.02 -- Changes to Updating box scores so it is driven by a List<>.
